# Lathe 3D Printer


## Idea
Most modern 3D filament printers print onto a flat plane, limiting parts of the design. 

The purpose of this printer design would to print onto a 

The printer would not be as generalized as a flat bedded design, but could help in prototyping rounded designs. The printer could even print onto objects that are not uniform.

## Issues
If a user wanted to print onto a nonuniform object, the object has to have a virtual counterpart so the software slices correctly.
